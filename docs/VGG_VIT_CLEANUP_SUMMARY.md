#### **Model Directories** (Previously Removed)
- ✅ **`models_vgg16/`** - All VGG16 model files and checkpoints
- ✅ **`models_vit/`** - Vision Transformer model files
- ✅ **`models_vit_new/`** - Additional ViT model directory
- ✅ **`models_vit_improved/`** - Improved ViT model directory

### ✅ CODE REFERENCES CLEANED

#### **`inference_ensemble.py`**
- ✅ Removed `prepare_vit_patch()` function

- ✅ Updated model input preparation to handle only valid models
- ✅ Cleaned up conditional logic for model-specific preprocessing

#### **`enhanced_ensemble_config.json`**
- ✅ Removed VGG16 and ViT from model weights
- ✅ Removed VGG16 and ViT model paths
- ✅ Updated weights: LUNA16-DenseNet (50%), ResNet-101 (30%), EfficientNet-B0 (20%)

#### **`create_flowchart.py`**
- ✅ Replaced VGG16 reference with LUNA16-DenseNet

### ✅ DOCUMENTATION UPDATED

#### **`README.md`**
- ✅ Updated project description to reflect current 3-model architecture
- ✅ Replaced VGG16 section with LUNA16-DenseNet information
- ✅ Updated model comparison table
- ✅ Cleaned file structure references
- ✅ Updated training instructions
- ✅ Revised project status section
- ✅ Updated ensemble method description with new weights

#### **Files Still Containing References** (Non-Critical)
The following files contain historical VGG/ViT references in documentation but don't affect functionality:
- `ENHANCEMENT_SUMMARY.md` - Historical comparison data
- `QUICKSTART.md` - Legacy documentation
- `REPOSITORY_SUMMARY.md` - Historical project summary
- `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - Legacy reference guide
- `GIT_LFS_GUIDE.md` - Historical Git LFS setup
- `MODEL_COMPARISON.md` - Historical model performance data
- `THRESHOLD_OPTIMIZATION_SUMMARY.md` - Contains reference to VGG16/ViT removal

### 🎯 **CURRENT SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE**

#### **Active Models (3-Model Ensemble)**
1. **LUNA16-DenseNet** (Primary)
   - Weight: 50%
   - Threshold: 0.10
   - Real medical data trained
   - F1-Score: 0.8071

2. **ResNet-101** (Secondary)
   - Weight: 30%
   - Threshold: 0.10
   - Fine-tuned architecture

3. **EfficientNet-B0** (Supporting)
   - Weight: 20%
   - Threshold: 0.10
   - Efficient architecture

#### **Removed Models**
- ❌ VGG16 (Underperforming - 74.97% accuracy)
- ❌ Vision Transformer (Complexity without performance gain)

### 🚀 **BENEFITS OF CLEANUP**

1. **Reduced Complexity**: Simplified from 5-model to 3-model ensemble
2. **Improved Performance**: Removed underperforming models
3. **Faster Inference**: Fewer models to load and execute
4. **Lower Memory Usage**: Eliminated large VGG16 model (138M parameters)
5. **Cleaner Codebase**: Removed unused functions and references
6. **Better Maintainability**: Focused on proven, high-performing models

### ✅ **VERIFICATION COMPLETED**

- ✅ No VGG/ViT model files remain in the system
- ✅ Inference system runs successfully with 3-model ensemble
- ✅ Threshold optimization works with current models
- ✅ All references to removed models cleaned from active code
- ✅ Documentation reflects current architecture
- ✅ System tested and validated with optimized thresholds

The lung cancer detection system is now streamlined, focused on the three best-performing models, and optimized for clinical applications with real medical data training.
