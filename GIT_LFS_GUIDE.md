# 📦 Git LFS Setup for Models

## ✅ What Was Done

Your trained models have been successfully added to the repository using **Git LFS (Large File Storage)**!

### Files Configured
- ✅ **Git LFS installed** and initialized
- ✅ **Tracking `.pth` files** (PyTorch models)
- ✅ **Tracking `.pkl` files** (pickle files)
- ✅ **All model directories added**:
  - `models_resnet101/` (ResNet-101: 523 MB)
  - `models_efficientnet/` (EfficientNet-B0)
  - `models_vgg16/` (VGG16)
  - `models_vit/` (Vision Transformer)
  - `models_vit_improved/`
  - `models_cnn/` (Original CNN)
  - `models_cnn_balanced/`
  - `models/` (XGBoost and feature files)

## 🎯 How Git LFS Works

Git LFS replaces large files with small pointer files in your Git repository. The actual large files are stored on a separate LFS server.

### Benefits:
- ✅ **Faster cloning** - Small pointer files instead of large binaries
- ✅ **Efficient storage** - Large files stored separately
- ✅ **Version control** - Track model versions without bloating repo
- ✅ **GitHub compatible** - Works seamlessly with GitHub

### Storage Limits:
- **Free GitHub**: 1 GB LFS storage + 1 GB bandwidth/month
- **Your models**: ~600+ MB (within free tier!)
- **Paid plans**: More storage available if needed

## 🚀 Pushing to GitHub

### Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `CAD-C`
3. Description: "Deep learning system for lung cancer detection"
4. **Public** or **Private**
5. **Do NOT** initialize with README
6. Click **"Create repository"**

### Step 2: Add Remote and Push
```bash
# Add your GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/CAD-C.git

# Push everything (code + models via LFS)
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Verify Upload
After pushing, check:
- ✅ Code files appear normally
- ✅ `.pth` and `.pkl` files show "Stored with Git LFS" badge
- ✅ Model files are downloadable

## 📥 Cloning Repository (For Others)

When someone clones your repository:

```bash
# Clone the repository (Git LFS downloads models automatically)
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/CAD-C.git
cd CAD-C

# Models are automatically downloaded!
# No extra steps needed
```

---

## 🔧 Git LFS Commands (Reference)

### Check LFS Status
```bash
git lfs status
```

### List Tracked Files
```bash
git lfs ls-files
```

### View LFS Configuration
```bash
git lfs env
```

### Track Additional File Types
```bash
git lfs track "*.h5"      # For Keras models
git lfs track "*.ckpt"    # For checkpoints
git lfs track "*.safetensors"  # For Hugging Face models
```

### Untrack File Type (if needed)
```bash
git lfs untrack "*.pth"
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### First Push May Take Time
- **~600+ MB** of models need to be uploaded
- Depending on your internet speed, this could take 10-30 minutes
- The push is done once; future pushes are fast

### GitHub LFS Bandwidth
- **Free tier**: 1 GB/month download bandwidth
- Each time someone clones, it uses bandwidth
- If you exceed, you can:
  - Wait until next month (resets)
  - Upgrade to paid plan
  - Use GitHub Releases for models instead

### Alternative: GitHub Releases
If you want to avoid LFS bandwidth limits:
```bash
# Remove models from Git
git lfs uninstall
git rm --cached models_*/best_*.pth
git commit -m "Remove models from Git, will use Releases"
git push

# Then manually upload .pth files to GitHub Releases
```

## 📊 Your Current Setup

### Committed Files
```
.gitattributes              # Git LFS configuration
.gitignore                  # Includes models now
models_resnet101/
  ├── best_resnet101_model.pth (523 MB) - Git LFS
  ├── training_history.csv
  ├── test_results.json
  └── [visualization plots]
models_efficientnet/
  ├── best_efficientnet_model.pth - Git LFS
  └── [results files]
models_vgg16/
  ├── best_vgg16_model.pth - Git LFS
  └── [results files]
models/
  ├── feature_scaler.pkl - Git LFS
  ├── feature_names.pkl - Git LFS
  └── xgboost_smote_model.pkl - Git LFS
```

### Git Status
```bash
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

## 🎓 Best Practices

### DO:
- ✅ Commit model checkpoints with LFS
- ✅ Include training results (CSV, JSON, plots)
- ✅ Document model versions in commit messages
- ✅ Tag releases with version numbers

### DON'T:
- ❌ Commit datasets (too large, users should download)
- ❌ Commit temporary files (.tmp, .cache)
- ❌ Commit virtual environments
- ❌ Force push after pushing LFS files

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "This exceeds GitHub's file size limit"
**Solution**: You're already using Git LFS! Make sure `.gitattributes` is committed.

### Issue: LFS objects not pushing
```bash
# Push LFS objects explicitly
git lfs push origin main --all
```

### Issue: Clone doesn't download models
```bash
# Install Git LFS first
git lfs install

# Then pull LFS objects
git lfs pull
```

### Issue: Out of LFS bandwidth
**Options**:
1. Wait until next month (bandwidth resets)
2. Upgrade GitHub plan
3. Use GitHub Releases for model distribution
4. Host models on alternative service (Google Drive, S3)

---

## 🌟 Summary

✅ **Models Added**: All trained models in repository
✅ **Git LFS Configured**: Efficient large file handling
✅ **Within Free Tier**: ~600 MB (< 1 GB limit)
✅ **Ready to Push**: No additional steps needed

### Final Commands:
```bash
# If you haven't created the repository yet:
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/CAD-C.git
git push -u origin main

# That's it! Models will upload automatically via LFS
```
