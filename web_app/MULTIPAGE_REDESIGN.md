## 📁 New File Structure

### HTML Pages
1. **`landing.html`** - Landing page with interactive 3D lung model hero section
2. **`analyze.html`** - Image upload and analysis page (formerly index.html)
3. **`about.html`** - Comprehensive about page with technology details

### CSS Files
1. **`css/landing.css`** - Landing page specific styles
2. **`css/about.css`** - About page styles (imports landing.css)
3. **`css/style.css`** - Analyze page styles (dark theme with glassmorphism)

### JavaScript Files

### Flask Routes
```python
@app.route('/')                 # Landing page
@app.route('/analyze')          # Analysis page
@app.route('/about')            # About page
@app.route('/api/predict')      # Prediction endpoint
@app.route('/api/models')       # Model info endpoint
@app.route('/api/health')       # Health check
```
